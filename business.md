# Background

For each type of analysis think about:

 - What problem does it solve, and for whom?
 - How is it being solved today?
 - How can it beneficially affect business?
 - What are the data inputs and where do they come from?
 - What are the outputs and how are they consumed- (online algorithm, a static report, etc)
 - Is this a revenue leakage ("saves us money") or a revenue growth ("makes us money") problem?

# Use Cases By Function

## Marketing

 - Predicting Lifetime Value (LTV)
    - what for: if you can predict the characteristics of high LTV customers, this supports customer segmentation, identifies upsell opportunties and supports other marketing initiatives 
    - usage: can be both an online algorithm and a static report showing the characteristics of high LTV customers
   


 - Wallet share estimation
    - working out the proportion of a customer's spend in a category accrues to a company allows that company to identify upsell and cross-sell opportunities    
    - usage: can be both an online algorithm and a static report showing the characteristics of low wallet share customers 
    - competitions : 
  

 - Churn
    - working out the characteristics of churners allows a company to product adjustments and an online algorithm allows them to reach out to churners 
    - usage: can be both an online algorithm and a statistic report showing the characteristics of likely churners 


 - Customer segmentation
    - If you can understand qualitatively different customer groups, then we can give them different treatments (perhaps even by different groups in the company). Answers questions like: what makes people buy, stop buying etc
    - usage: static report

    - usage: online algorithm 


 - Up selling 
    - Given a customer's characteristics, what is the likelihood that they'll upgrade in the future?
