\section{Example of using Data Science in Business}

When we apply Data Science to Business, we mean two broad directions:

\begin{itemize}
\item We try to replace what humans have been currently doing with machines, and Machine Learning is the key to this advancement
\item By doing so, we want to beat human's performance
\end{itemize}

With these principles in mind, we consider some of the workflows of businesses to determine what is happening to each case.  

\subsection{CRM}

Propensity Model 

\subsection{Non-CRM Based}

\subsubsection{Space}

Optimization based originally.  The problem is well defined, so the solution is well defined.  

\subsubsection{Supply Chain}

Optimization based in convention

\subsubsection{Human Resource}

No particular solution, but there are many new ideas.  

Scraping of documents

Obtaining a profile for labour availability or trends

\subsection{Conclusion}

If the problem is complex: machine learning
If the problem is not complex: optimization  5
