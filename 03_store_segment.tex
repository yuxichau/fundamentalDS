\section{Store Segmentation: Walk-through of common practices}

There are two schools of thought.  

\subsection{Rule-based Segmentation}

Good for explainability, but often unimgainative. 

\subsection{Unsupervised Learning}

Bad for explainability.  This is often overated and should be taken with a pinch of salt.  

Clustering 

\subsection{Micro-Segmentation}

Some say that we are approaching this question with the concept of micro-segmentation.
